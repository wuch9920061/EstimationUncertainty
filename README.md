This project aims to quantify estimation uncertainty (a part of epistemic uncertainty that is due to the use of a limited number of ground motion sets). The source codes are programmed in R.

The theoretical background is documented in the paper, C. Wu and H.V.Burton. Effects of probability model misspecification on the number of ground motions required for seismic performance assessment. Earthquake Spectra. DOI: 10.1177/87552930241262044


### The functionality of the main script

`SE_for_CodeBasedAnalysis.R` is to calculate the standard errors of the two parameters in a lognormally distributed probabilistic seismic demand model (PSDM). That is, the
