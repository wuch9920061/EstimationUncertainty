This project aims to quantify estimation uncertainty (a part of epistemic uncertainty that due to the use of limited ground motion sets). The source codes are programmed in R.

The theoretical background is documented in the paper, C. Wu and H.V.Burton. Effects of probability model misspecification on the number of ground motions required for seismic performance assessment. Earthquake Spectra. DOI: 10.1177/87552930241262044
